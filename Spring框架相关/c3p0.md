#### C3p0:JDBC DataSources/Resource Polls

c3p0 is an easy-to-use library for augmenting traditional (DriverManager-based) JDBC drivers with JNDI-bindable DataSources, including DataSources that implement Connection and Statement Pooling, as described by the jdbc3 spec and jdbc2 std extension.

#### Using c3p0 with Hibernate

#### 1. Overview

It's quite expensive to establish database connections. Database connection pooling is a well-established way to lower this expenditure.

#### 2.What is c3p0?

**c3p0 is a Java library that provides a convenient way for managing database connections.**

In short, it achieves this by creating a pool of connections. It also effectively handles the cleanup of Statements and ResultSets after use. This cleanup is necessary to ensure that resource usage is optimized and avoidable deadlocks do not occur.

**This library integrates seamlessly with various traditional JDBC drivers.** Additionally, it provides a layer for adapting DriverManager-based JDBC drivers to the newer ***javax.sql.DataSource*** scheme.

And, because Hibernate support connecting to databases over JDBC, **it's simple to use Hibernate and c3p0 together**.
