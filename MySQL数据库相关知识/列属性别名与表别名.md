#### 列属性别名与表别名

别名关键字 ```AS```.

#### 1. 列属性别名

MySQL support for aliases on tables and column as required by standard SQL.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) AS full_name
FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
```

The ```AS``` keyword is optional when aliasing a ```select_expr``` with an identifier. The preceding example could have been written like this:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) full_name
FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;
```

#### 2.表别名

```sql
SELECT p1.name, p1.sex, p2.name, p2.sex, p1.species
FROM pet AS p1 INNER JOIN pet AS p2
ON p1.species = p2.species
AND p1.sex = 'f' AND p1.death IS NULL
AND p2.sex = 'm' AND p2.death IS NULL;
```

In this query, we specify aliases for the table name to refer to the columns and keep straight which instance of the table each column reference is associated with.
